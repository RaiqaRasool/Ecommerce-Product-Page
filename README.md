### What I learned

This project helped me a lot to revise my JS concepts. Things that I learnt are:
1. getElementsByClassName give html collection on which forEach not work and how I can use Array.from to convert HTML collection to array.
2. I learnt about -webkit-tap-highlight-color to remove highlighting of clickable areas.
3. Came to know about filter css property to have blur, grayscale and other filter affects.
4. Got idea about how I can use border to have underline at distance on hover in menu.
5. Loved to make slider and lightbox with only js and css without using any library or code from internet, did all of it on my own by making logics.

### Continued development

 I have not used OOP concepts of JS in this project that's why I think it becomes little messy, that's why I am thinking of sharpening my OOP JS  concepts and using them in future to keep my code clean and neat.
